# OP_NET Proposal

This repository contains all the proposal regarding OP_NET and it's changelog.

## OP_NET 1.1.0 (pre-alpha) - What's Coming in the next OP_NET Update?

### 1. New RPC Methods

#### Breaking Change: `btc_simulate`
- **Overview:** The `btc_simulate` method has been significantly enhanced to support more complex simulations.
- **New Features:**
  - State overwrites.
  - Contract code insertion or overwriting by address.
  - Multiple transaction simulations in a sequence (e.g., a -> b -> c).
- **Simulation Actions:**
  - Define an optional sender for contracts.
  - Override custom states.
  - Define or overwrite contract code at specific addresses.
  - Simulate multiple transactions in a chain.
- **Simulation Results:**
  1. Affected states for each transaction with their values.
  2. Transaction receipts, including events, reverts, etc.
  3. Gas estimation for each transaction (convertible to sat).

#### New RPC Method: `btc_fee`
- **Purpose:** Returns the current estimated Bitcoin mining fees based on the last three blocks.
- **Response:**
  1. **Low:** Lowest estimated fee.
  2. **Normal:** Standard fee.
  3. **Priority:** Highest estimated fee for faster confirmation.

#### New RPC Method: `btc_gas`
- **Purpose:** Provides gas usage data to estimate the fee required for priority transactions.
- **Response:**
  1. **Top:** Average priority fee over the last three blocks.
  2. **Optimal:** Median priority fee for the last block.
  3. **Rate:** Projected future usage.

#### New RPC Method: `btc_chaininfo`

#### Modification: `btc_getUTXOs`
- **Breaking Change:** The method now takes an object parameter with additional filtering options.
- **New Parameters Example:**
  ```json
	{
		"query": {
			"address": "str", (string) 
			"filterOrdinals": true|false, (boolean) Filter ordinals UTXOs
			"pending": true|false, (boolean) (optional) return only pending UTXOs
		}[],
		"requiredAmount": n, (numeric) (optional) return at least x amount in sat, otherwise, throw.
	}
  ```

#### Modification: `btc_getBalance`
- **New Parameter:** `includePendingBalance` added to the existing address and filterOrdinals parameters.
- **Response:** Remains unchanged.

### 2. Support for WebSockets
- **Overview:** RPC methods can now be called via WebSocket for improved speed.
- **Event Subscriptions:**
  1. On "block"
  2. On "transaction"
  3. On "epoch"
  4. On "nextBestEpoch"

### 3. Contract Updates

#### Runtime Breaking Changes:
- **Renaming:**
  - `callee` is now `from` (represents who sent the transaction).
  - `caller` is now `sender` (represents the original sender).
- **New Additions:**
  - Solidity-like constructor method (`onContractInstantiate`).
  - OP_20 uses storage slots for defining constant properties, allowing deployment from a factory contract.
  - New `StoredBoolean` type added.

### 4. Pending UTXO Tracking
- **Feature:** OP_NET now tracks pending UTXOs.
