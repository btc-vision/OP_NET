# OPNet Transaction Processing Optimization: **State-Aware Parallelism**

## Overview

The **State-Aware Parallelism** principle optimizes transaction processing in OPNet by leveraging parallel execution for independent transactions while ensuring proper handling of dependencies between transactions. This principle boosts performance without compromising the integrity of the system's state, and further optimizes transaction processing using promises and context blocking to await state availability before resuming execution.

## How It Works

### 1. Batch Execution of Transactions
- All transactions (txs) in a block are gathered and processed as a batch.
- Each transaction is assumed to be independent at first, allowing concurrent execution across multiple CPU cores.

### 2. State Dependency Identification
- After transactions are processed, the system compares the **state changes** made by each transaction.
- Transactions that modify or rely on the same state (e.g., smart contract data) are marked as **dependent** on each other.
- This creates **chains of dependent transactions** that need to be executed sequentially, as their outcomes depend on the state changes caused by earlier transactions.

### 3. Parallel Execution for Independent Transactions
- Transactions that **do not share state** can be processed in parallel:
  - Example: A swap transaction involving **Banana Token** can run in parallel with a swap involving **Bob Token**, as long as they modify separate states.
- If a transaction does not modify shared state, it can be run across different CPU cores simultaneously, significantly improving execution speed.

### 4. Handling Dependent Transactions
- Transactions that depend on shared states must be executed **sequentially**.
- These transactions are flagged as dependent, forming a **dependency chain**, ensuring the correct order of execution.

### 5. Multithreading for Performance
- By running independent transactions in parallel across multiple CPU cores, **State-Aware Parallelism** reduces block processing time.
- Independent transactions could see up to **1000%** performance improvement, depending on system hardware and the proportion of independent vs. dependent transactions.

### 6. Limitations
- The system cannot parallelize transactions that **share state dependencies**. These must be processed in a specific order, limiting speed improvements for those particular transactions.

## Handling Transaction Reverts Due to Missing State

### Why a Transaction May Revert Due to Missing State
In **State-Aware Parallelism**, transactions misclassified as independent may revert if they rely on the state modified by another transaction. When the required state is not available, the dependent transaction reverts. This can cause state inconsistencies and performance degradation due to reprocessing.

### Effects of a Transaction Revert
- **State Integrity**: A reverted transaction indicates an undetected dependency, potentially compromising the system’s integrity.
- **Execution Order**: Reverts highlight dependencies that should have been sequentially executed.
- **Performance Costs**: Reverts lead to redundant computation, reducing efficiency gains from parallel execution.

### Managing Reverts Due to Missing State

#### 1. Dependency Re-evaluation and Transaction Reclassification
- Upon detecting a revert, the system re-evaluates dependencies and reclassifies affected transactions as dependent. They are then added to the sequential execution queue.

#### 2. Transaction Rollback and Re-execution
- Reverted transactions are rolled back and re-executed after the missing state becomes available, ensuring proper processing.

#### 3. Speculative Execution with Checkpoints
- Transactions can be speculatively executed with **checkpoints**, where the system verifies if a state conflict exists before committing changes. This avoids reverts and wasted computation.

#### 4. Transaction Dependency Prediction Using Heuristics
- Heuristics can be employed to predict transaction dependencies and prevent misclassification, minimizing reverts.

## Optimizing Compute with Promises and Context Blocking

### Asynchronous State Availability in Transaction Processing

Using **promises** and **context blocking** in Rust threads, OPNet can pause the execution of dependent transactions until the required state becomes available, preventing reverts and redundant processing.

### 1. Parallel Execution with Promise-Based State Awaiting
- Independent transactions run in parallel across multiple threads.
- Dependent transactions await state availability using promises:
  - If the required state is unavailable, the transaction is paused using a promise.
  - The system processes other transactions while the paused transaction waits.

### 2. Context Blocking for Dependent Transactions
- Dependent transactions use **context blocking** if they require an unavailable state:
  - The transaction thread is paused without reverting or retrying, minimizing wasted computation.
  - The thread resumes execution once the necessary state is updated.

### 3. Non-Blocking Promises and Resumable Execution
- The system uses **non-blocking promises** to monitor state availability:
  - When the state becomes available, the promise is fulfilled, and the paused transaction resumes from where it left off.

### 4. Sequential and Parallel Scheduling Hybrid
- Independent transactions run in parallel across CPU cores.
- Dependent transactions pause and resume dynamically based on state availability, ensuring optimal compute usage.

### Example Scenario

- **Transaction A** modifies the state of a smart contract.
- **Transaction B**, which depends on the updated state from Transaction A, waits using a promise.
- **Transaction C**, which is independent of both A and B, runs in parallel.
- Once **Transaction A** completes, the promise for **Transaction B** is fulfilled, and **Transaction B** resumes execution without restarting.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Avoiding Costly Reverts**: Transactions pause and await state updates rather than reverting, reducing redundant computations.
2. **Optimizing CPU Usage**: Dependent transactions do not consume CPU cycles while waiting, allowing better resource allocation.
3. **Increased Throughput**: The system efficiently handles more transactions by minimizing delays caused by state dependencies.
4. **Smoother Transaction Flow**: Reduced retries and reverts lead to smoother overall block processing.

## Key Advantages of **State-Aware Parallelism**

- **Optimized Performance**: Running independent transactions in parallel drastically reduces block processing time.
- **Scalability**: As more CPU cores are available, OPNet can handle a larger transaction load.
- **State Integrity**: Ensuring dependent transactions are processed sequentially maintains system security and consistency.

## Challenges

- **State Dependency Detection**: Efficiently identifying dependencies between transactions is crucial for maximizing parallel execution.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Proper concurrency management is essential to prevent race conditions or state conflicts when running transactions in parallel.

## Conclusion

The **State-Aware Parallelism** principle, combined with asynchronous state availability using promises and context blocking, optimizes OPNet’s transaction throughput by minimizing reverts, reducing redundant processing, and maximizing parallel execution where possible. This ensures OPNet is both **scalable** and **secure**, allowing for efficient, high-performance transaction processing in a decentralized environment.
