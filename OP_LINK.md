By utilizing **Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW)** and **OP_NET indexers**, it ensures that asset transfers are secure, tamper-resistant, and synchronized between the parent chain and the child chain.In OP_LINK, when an AuxPoW block is mined and detected on the **child chain**, **OP_NET indexers** automatically trigger smart contracts on both the parent and child chains. These contracts manage the burning and minting of assets in a secure, cryptographic manner. OP_LINK ensures that the entire bridging process remains decentralized, with no reliance on centralized authorities.## Key Concepts and Definitions### OP_NET-Based AssetsThese are assets created and managed using the OP_NET protocol, which can be transferred between different chains (e.g., Bitcoin, Fractal, Litecoin). They can include tokens, smart contract states, or other programmable assets.### Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW)Auxiliary Proof of Work allows a child chain (e.g., Fractal) to reuse the mining power of a parent chain (e.g., Bitcoin). The child chain benefits from the parent chain’s security while maintaining its own blockchain. **AuxPoW** only works when both chains use the same **Proof of Work (PoW)** algorithm.### OP_NET Indexers (Validators)**OP_NET indexers** are decentralized entities responsible for:- **Triggering smart contracts** when an AuxPoW block is detected.- **Generating cryptographic proofs** of state changes on both the parent and child chains.- **Relaying and verifying proofs** to ensure assets are transferred securely between chains.### Cryptographic ProofsThese are cryptographic signatures generated by OP_NET indexers that prove a state change has occurred (e.g., an asset has been burned on one chain and minted on another). These proofs ensure that the state changes are valid across both chains involved in the asset transfer.### Smart ContractsOP_NET relies on smart contracts to manage the asset bridging process. When an AuxPoW block is detected, the smart contracts are triggered to burn assets on one chain and mint equivalent assets on the other.## How OP_LINK Achieves Trustless and Decentralized BridgingOP_LINK uses a combination of **AuxPoW** and **indexers** to ensure that asset transfers between chains are trustless and decentralized. The entire process of transferring assets between chains (e.g., from Bitcoin to Fractal) is governed by cryptographic proofs and decentralized validation.### Example: Transferring Assets Between Bitcoin and FractalLet’s walk through the steps for transferring an OP_NET-based asset from Bitcoin (parent chain) to Fractal (child chain):1. **Initiating the Transfer**: - The user initiates a transfer of OP_NET-based assets (e.g., tokens) from Bitcoin to Fractal. - This action locks the OP_NET-based assets in a smart contract on Bitcoin, preparing them for cross-chain transfer.2. **AuxPoW Block Detection on Fractal**: - An AuxPoW block is detected on the child chain (Fractal). - OP_NET indexers automatically trigger the bridging contracts on both Bitcoin and Fractal.3. **Generating and Matching Cryptographic Proofs**: - Indexers on both Bitcoin and Fractal generate cryptographic proofs for the state changes. - These proofs are compared, and if they match, it confirms that the AuxPoW block was valid.4. **Burning Assets on Bitcoin**: - After validating the proofs, the bridging contract burns the locked OP_NET-based assets on Bitcoin.5. **Minting New Assets on Fractal**: - Equivalent OP_NET-based assets are minted on Fractal, completing the transfer. - The user now holds the assets on Fractal.The process works in reverse when transferring assets from the child chain back to the parent chain (Fractal to Bitcoin). The user burns the assets on Fractal, and equivalent assets are minted on Bitcoin after the necessary cryptographic proofs are validated.## Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW)AuxPoW allows the child chain to benefit from the parent chain’s mining power. It enables the child chain (e.g., Fractal) to reuse the parent chain’s security (e.g., Bitcoin).- **AuxPoW Block**: When an AuxPoW block is detected on the child chain, it triggers asset bridging contracts on both chains.- **Mining Algorithm Compatibility**: AuxPoW only works if both the parent and child chains use the same mining algorithm (e.g., SHA-256 for Bitcoin and Fractal).## OP_NET IndexersOP_NET indexers play a critical role in ensuring the security and trustlessness of the asset transfers. They are responsible for:- **Triggering smart contracts**: When an AuxPoW block is detected, indexers trigger smart contracts on both chains.- **Generating cryptographic proofs**: Indexers generate the necessary cryptographic proofs for validating the state changes and asset transfers.- **Synchronizing state transitions**: Indexers ensure that assets are burned on one chain and minted on the other.## Smart Contracts in OP_NETOP_NET’s smart contracts govern the entire asset bridging process. These contracts are automatically triggered by the detection of an AuxPoW block on the child chain. They ensure that:- **Assets are locked, burned, or minted** according to the cryptographic proofs generated by the indexers.- **Proofs are validated**: The smart contracts validate the cryptographic proofs provided by the indexers, ensuring that only valid transfers are processed.- **State transitions are secure**: The contracts ensure that assets are burned on one chain before being minted on another, preventing double-spending or asset duplication.## Multi-Chain BridgingOP_LINK supports the transfer of OP_NET-based assets between multiple chains, as long as the chains use the same mining algorithm.### Example: Bridging Between Litecoin, Bells, and Dogecoin1. **Transferring from Litecoin to Bells**: - The assets are locked on Litecoin, an AuxPoW block is detected on Bells, and new assets are minted on Bells after indexers validate the cryptographic proofs.2. **Transferring from Bells to Dogecoin**: - The same process is followed for transferring assets from Bells to Dogecoin. Indexers trigger the necessary bridging contracts and generate cryptographic proofs to synchronize the state changes.## Limitations of AuxPoW- **Algorithm Dependency**: AuxPoW can only be used when both the parent and child chains share the same mining algorithm. For example, Bitcoin and Fractal use **SHA-256**, making AuxPoW possible between these two chains. If a chain uses a different algorithm (e.g., Scrypt), AuxPoW cannot be applied, and an alternative mechanism would be required.
