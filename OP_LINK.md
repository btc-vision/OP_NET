By utilizing **Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW)** and **OP_NET indexers**, it ensures that asset transfers are secure, tamper-resistant, and synchronized between the parent chain and the child chain.In OP_LINK, when an AuxPoW block is mined and detected on the **child chain**, **OP_NET indexers** automatically trigger smart contracts on both the parent and child chains. These contracts manage the burning and minting of assets in a secure, cryptographic manner. OP_LINK ensures that the entire bridging process remains decentralized, with no reliance on centralized authorities.## Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW)Auxiliary Proof of Work allows a child chain (e.g., Fractal) to reuse the mining power of a parent chain (e.g., Bitcoin). The child chain benefits from the parent chain’s security while maintaining its own blockchain. **AuxPoW** only works when both chains use the same **Proof of Work (PoW)** algorithm.## How OP_LINK Achieves Trustless and Decentralized BridgingOP_LINK uses a combination of **AuxPoW** and **indexers** to ensure that asset transfers between chains are trustless and decentralized. The entire process of transferring assets between chains (e.g., from Bitcoin to Fractal) is governed by cryptographic proofs and decentralized validation.### Example: Transferring Assets Between Bitcoin and FractalLet’s walk through the steps for transferring an OP_NET-based asset from Bitcoin (parent chain) to Fractal (child chain):1. **Initiating the Transfer**:- The user initiates a transfer of OP_NET-based assets (e.g., tokens) from Bitcoin to Fractal.- This action locks the OP_NET-based assets in a smart contract on Bitcoin, preparing them for cross-chain transfer.2. **AuxPoW Block Detection on Fractal**:- An AuxPoW block is detected on the child chain (Fractal).- OP_NET indexers automatically trigger the bridging contracts on both Bitcoin and Fractal.3. **Generating and Matching Cryptographic Proofs**:- Indexers on both Bitcoin and Fractal generate cryptographic proofs for the state changes.- These proofs are compared, and if they match, it confirms that the AuxPoW block was valid.4. **Burning Assets on Bitcoin**:- After validating the proofs, the bridging contract burns the locked OP_NET-based assets on Bitcoin.5. **Minting New Assets on Fractal**:- Equivalent OP_NET-based assets are minted on Fractal, completing the transfer.- The user now holds the assets on Fractal.The process works in reverse when transferring assets from the child chain back to the parent chain (Fractal to Bitcoin). The user burns the assets on Fractal, and equivalent assets are minted on Bitcoin after the necessary cryptographic proofs are validated.## Anchor Points: Secure and Decentralized Bridging Between Parent and Child ChainsIn OP_LINK, an **Anchor Point** is a deployed contract on both the **parent** and **child** chains that forms the foundation of the bridge between them. The anchor point ensures that both contracts on the parent and child chains are linked securely, having been created and owned by the same user. This linking guarantees that the bridge is trustless and verifiable.### How Anchor Points WorkThe concept of anchor points allows users to establish a cryptographically linked bridge between two contracts on different chains (e.g., Bitcoin and Fractal). These contracts serve as the foundation for cross-chain interactions, ensuring that assets can be transferred between chains securely.#### Requirements for Linking Contracts1. **Ownership of Contracts**:    - The user must own the contract deployed on the **parent chain**.    - The user must also own the contract deployed on the **child chain**.2. **Linking Process**:    - The user sends a **link request** to the **bridging contract address (CA)** on the **parent chain**, specifying the address of their corresponding contract on the **child chain**.    - The same process is repeated on the **child chain**, where the user specifies the contract address on the parent chain.### The Anchor Point PrincipleBy using anchor points, users can guarantee that the contracts on both chains have been created and controlled by the same entity. This **matching of contracts** between chains provides a high level of security and assurance for cross-chain transfers.- **Ownership Verification**: The system ensures that the same user owns the contracts on both the parent and child chains.- **Security**: Since the user controls both contracts, this eliminates the risk of unauthorized bridging or tampering with the assets being transferred.### Benefits of Anchor Points in OP_LINK- **Trustless Contract Linking**: The anchor point mechanism guarantees that the user has full control over the contracts on both chains, providing security for the bridge.- **Secure Cross-Chain Transfers**: Only contracts owned and linked by the same user can participate in asset transfers, preventing unauthorized access.- **Decentralized Matching**: Users can independently link their contracts across chains without relying on a central authority to verify ownership.## Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW)AuxPoW allows the child chain to benefit from the parent chain’s mining power. It enables the child chain (e.g., Fractal) to reuse the parent chain’s security (e.g., Bitcoin).- **AuxPoW Block**: When an AuxPoW block is detected on the child chain, it triggers asset bridging contracts on both chains.- **Mining Algorithm Compatibility**: AuxPoW only works if both the parent and child chains use the same mining algorithm (e.g., SHA-256 for Bitcoin and Fractal).## OP_NET IndexersOP_NET indexers play a critical role in ensuring the security and trustlessness of the asset transfers. They are responsible for:- **Triggering smart contracts**: When an AuxPoW block is detected, indexers trigger smart contracts on both chains.- **Generating cryptographic proofs**: Indexers generate the necessary cryptographic proofs for validating the state changes and asset transfers.- **Synchronizing state transitions**: Indexers ensure that assets are burned on one chain and minted on the other.## Smart Contracts in OP_NETOP_NET’s smart contracts govern the entire asset bridging process. These contracts are automatically triggered by the detection of an AuxPoW block on the child chain. They ensure that:- **Assets are locked, burned, or minted** according to the cryptographic proofs generated by the indexers.- **Proofs are validated**: The smart contracts validate the cryptographic proofs provided by the indexers, ensuring that only valid transfers are processed.- **State transitions are secure**: The contracts ensure that assets are burned on one chain before being minted on another, preventing double-spending or asset duplication.## Multi-Chain BridgingOP_LINK supports the transfer of OP_NET-based assets between multiple chains, as long as the chains use the same mining algorithm.### Example: Bridging Between Litecoin, Bells, and Dogecoin1. **Transferring from Litecoin to Bells**: - The assets are locked on Litecoin, an AuxPoW block is detected on Bells, and new assets are minted on Bells after indexers validate the cryptographic proofs.2. **Transferring from Bells to Dogecoin**: - The same process is followed for transferring assets from Bells to Dogecoin. Indexers trigger the necessary bridging contracts and generate cryptographic proofs to synchronize the state changes.## Limitations of AuxPoW- **Algorithm Dependency**: AuxPoW can only be used when both the parent and child chains share the same mining algorithm. For example, Bitcoin and Fractal use **SHA-256**, making AuxPoW possible between these two chains. If a chain uses a different algorithm (e.g., Scrypt), AuxPoW cannot be applied, and an alternative mechanism would be required.
